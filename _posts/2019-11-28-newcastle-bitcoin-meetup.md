The Newcastle Bitcoin Meetup is BACK! And this time we have 3 great speakers lined up to help you sharpen your inevitable Christmas Bitcoin pitch!

Pete Cheyne ([@btcpete](https://twitter.com/btcpete)) - Founder of Bottle Pay
"Making Bitcoin Accessible For Everyone"

Neil Woodfine ([@nwoodfine](https://twitter.com/nwoodfine)) - Director of Marketing at Blockstream
"Offline Bitcoin Transactions"
Bitcoin is considered to be currency of the internet. But what happens if someone has a poor internet connection, or loses it entirely? Neil takes a look at the technologies being built to keep Bitcoin running regardless of network disruptions, including Blockstream Satellite and goTenna mesh networks.

"The Lightning Network - Where Are We Now?"
Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja published a draft of the Lightning white paper in February 2015. 4 years on, what is the state of play? What is being developed? How can you join in?

Whether you're completely new to Bitcoin and just interested in learning more, or have been mining on your graphics card since 2011, all are welcome.

We would like to give a huge thank you to our venue for hosting us, TusPark Newcastle Eagle Labs. Bottle Pay will also very kindly be providing drinks on the evening to lubricate some engaging conversation.

Look forward to seeing you there!
